            Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village
            though; He will not see me stopping here To watch his woods fill up
            with snow.

            My little horse must think it queer To stop without a farmhouse near
            Between the woods and frozen lake The darkest evening of the year.
            He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake.
            The only other soundâ€™s the sweep Of easy wind and downy flake. The
            woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And
            miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep
